to compile:
WINDOWS:
1. open the developer command prompt for vscode
2. run "cd [\path\to\lc3.c]"
3. run "cl lc3.c"

LINUX/MACOS:
1. open the terminal
2. run "cd [\path\to\lc3.c]"
3. run "gcc -o lc3.c lc3" (you can use the compiler of your choice)


the lc3 VM runs .obj files that have been built using an assembler like Lc3 tools (https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools).
in this repo, there is an already assembled .obj of the game 2048 from https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048

!!! MAKE SURE THE LC3 EXECUTABLE AND THE .OBJ FILE ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY !!!

to run a file:
WINDOWS:
1. open the CMD or the developer command prompt for vscode
2. run "cd [path\to\lc3.c]" (if you didn't already while compiling)
3. run "lc3 [path\to\.obj file]"

LINUX/MACOS:
1. open the terminal
2. run "cd [path\to\lc3.c]" (if you didn't already while compiling)
3. run "lc3 [path\to\.obj file]"
